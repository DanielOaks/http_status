HTTP Status
===========

A simple HTTP status code/name/description library for Python.

-----
Usage
-----

Use by itself::

    >>> import http_status
    >>> http_status.name[302]
    'Found'
    >>> http_status.description[302]
    'URI of this resource has changed, temporarily.'

Use of the Status object::

    >>> from http_status import Status
    >>> s = Status(403)
    >>> s.code
    403
    >>> s.name
    'Forbidden'
    >>> s.description
    'Client does not have rights to access the content.'

    >>> s.code = 405
    >>> s.name
    'Method Not Allowed'
    >>> s.description
    'Server has disabled this request method and cannot be used.'

Note that if the Status object does not have a name/description matching the
given code, it will return default strings (for compatability when directly
inserting ``Status.name`` and ``Status.description`` into format strings.

This can be changed by passing arguments ``name_fail`` and
``description_fail`` when you create Status::

    >>> from http_status import Status
    >>> s = Status(2435)
    >>> s.name
    'No HTTP Name'
    >>> s.description
    'No HTTP Description.'

    >>> from http_status import Status
    >>> s = Status(2435, name_fail='Nothing', description_fail='Nothing at all')
    >>> s.name
    'Nothing'
    >>> s.description
    'Nothing at all'

The class ``NoneStatus`` is exactly the same as Status, but ``name_fail``
and ``description_fail`` both default to None.
